# Memory Game

## About 
This memory was created for people who like memory games and for people who want to be able to train their memory.
The goal of this site was to build a fun and good looking game that is fun to play. 

I like memory games myself and wanted to create a game with themes that I like. 

### Creating 

I started by figuring out how I wanted the game to be structured and what different levels that would be included.

Since I myself prefer to be able to choose which the theme and make the game appealing i chose to have 3 different themes all on the same level. 

Each game has 30 cards with different pictures and a different background.

I started by making the index.html page and after i went for the first theme and chosing the icons to use in the game. 
After i did the second 2 themes and made all the visuall work and also the pictures. 

After the html and css park i started working with the javascript parts. Bit by bit and testing so the code worked. 

When the code worked i added a scoreboard and the correct javascript code to it. 

After this process i did the media so the game can be played on different screens. 


## UX

A simple and clean looking website that introduces a singel player memory with 3 different themes. 

A clean, fun and simple looking game. 
The images is all the same sizes in all 3 themes. 
When a player is finished with the game a popup will show with the timing and how many moves. In the poput you can also chose to play again or go to the main meny.

## Testing
I have been coding the whole project in visual studios due to some problems with the commit function. When i have been trying to commit code it just says that its up to date and no git commit/push can be done. Some commits works but not all. 
which made it difficult to work with. 

There was a big problem with the commit function and it ended up that I got help with it and have saved the code in the manual mode on github.
And then i started a new repo and tried to copy the code from the first repo that dident commit. And it now works better. 
I created the program in Visual studios then I have also used gitpod as best I can, partly for troubleshooting the code.
